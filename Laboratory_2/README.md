### Laboratory work nr. 2

In this laboratory work, there are implemented two classes: NFA and DFA, that describes
several proprieties of non-deterministic finite automata and, respectively, of deterministic
finite automaton.\
The main functions are implemented in the NFA class, DFA class calling them when it is 
requested. Despite transformation from NFA to DFA, the classes also offers visualisation
of FA characteristics, such as alphabet, states, transaction, etc. Nonetheless, the conversion
from NFA to a regular grammar is implemented. \
For the given variant (13), there are several words that can be checked if accepted by the
described FA:
* abaab - accepted;
* aabaa - not accepted.
If you look at the obtained grammar, it can be detect that it corresponds to the given FA.
